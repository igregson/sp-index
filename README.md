## SP-SMPL

A simple **s**tarting **p**oint for project starts. Uses NPM as a build tool and harnesses Harp.js for serving directly from Jade in development and easily compiling to a static build for deployment. Currently setup to use Stylus for styles (with a custom build process outside of Harp) and BrowserSync for powerful watching and syncing (that "just works" and works well).

## Usage

- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`
