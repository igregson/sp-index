## SP-SMPL

A simple **s**tarting **p**oint that uses NPM as a build tool to build Sass styles and do seemingly-magical multi-browser watching and syncing via BrowserSync.

## Usage

- `npm install`
- add a subdirectory to the the `assets-src` directory named `Sass`. Place styles there.
- `npm watch`

## More to Come

stay tuned :)
